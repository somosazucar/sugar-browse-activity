Description: web browsing activity for the Sugar graphical shell
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 Originating as integral part of the OLPC "XO" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
 Sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-ressource desktop
 environment for kids.
 .
 This package contains the Browse activity, providing a simple web
 browser based on the Mozilla Gecko engine.
