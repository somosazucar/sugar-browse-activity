Description: web activity for the Sugar graphical shell
 Sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.
 .
 This package contains the Chat activity, providing a simple interface
 for collaborative discussion, be it between two individuals or among a
 group as large as an entire classroom. While a lightweight and
 "impermanent" chat will be provided in a layer above all activities and
 the various mesh levels, this activity devoted to textual communication
 will keep detailed records of the conversation within the journal and
 provide a means of searching through the conversation to locate
 important comments.
